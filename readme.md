# Cyndi Loza

This repository is the source code for the website of journalist and editor Cyndi Loza.

The public display of this source code has several purposes:

- Transparency about my web development skills, which include familiarity with Django, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and Bash
- To encourage me to continue designing and developing with best practices as technology changes, particularly in migrations, version control, and deployment
- To establish street cred that I designed and developed this website in 2008 before the popularity that Django has today. There, I said it.
